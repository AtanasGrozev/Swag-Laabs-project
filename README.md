## Project Overview

This project is focused on **Manual and Automation testing** for the [Swag Labs website](https://www.saucedemo.com/). The testing processes include:

- **Manual Testing:** Fundamental functions were tested through manually executed, clearly reproducible steps, allowing us to verify expected versus actual results. You can review the manual testing documentation by downloading the file **Swag Labs Project.xlsx**.
- **Automation Testing:** Based on insights from the manual tests, automation scripts were developed using **Selenium WebDriver** in **C#**, following the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern to enhance readability and minimize code duplication.

## Technologies Used

- **Manual Testing**: Documentation in Swag Labs Project.xlsx
- **Automation Testing**: Selenium WebDriver, C#
- **Design Pattern**: Page Object Model (POM)

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

- **Manual_Tests**: Contains the **Swag Labs Project.xlsx** file documenting manual test cases.
- **Automation_Tests**: Contains test scripts in C# developed using the Selenium WebDriver and POM design pattern.

## Getting Started

To run the automation tests:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (Selenium WebDriver, etc.).
3. Run the test scripts in your preferred IDE.
